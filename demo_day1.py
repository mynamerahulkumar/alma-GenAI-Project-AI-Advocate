    Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
    It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.
    
    Python is widely used in various fields:
    1. Web Development - Django, Flask frameworks
    2. Data Science - Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
    3. Machine Learning - TensorFlow, PyTorch
    4. Automation - Scripts and tools
    5. Scientific Computing - Research and analysis
    
    The language emphasizes code readability and allows developers to express concepts
    in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
    
    Python's philosophy is embedded in the document called "The Zen of Python".
    Some key principles include:
    - Beautiful is better than ugly
    - Explicit is better than implicit
    - Simple is better than complex
    - Readability counts
    
    Python has a comprehensive standard library, often described as "batteries included".
    This means developers can find modules for most tasks without external dependencies.
